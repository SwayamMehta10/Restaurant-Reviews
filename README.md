# Restaurant-Reviews
This is a basic restaurant review web application with a serverless backend made using MERN stack i.e. MongoDB Express React Node.

This is my first step towards learning full stack web development.
You can fork or clone this repository and follow FreeCodeCamp's tutorial: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-mern-stack-app-with-a-serverless-backend/

## Note
I have made some changes of my own in the code (some commands/options in the tutorial have been deprecated/replaced in current versions).
