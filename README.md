# Restaurant-Reviews
This is a basic restaurant review web application with a serverless backend made using ```MERN``` stack i.e. MongoDB Express React Node.

This is my first step towards learning full stack web development.
You can fork or clone this repository and follow FreeCodeCamp's tutorial: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-mern-stack-app-with-a-serverless-backend/

## Procedure to run the server
1] Make sure you have ```node.js``` installed in your system. If not, go to https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and install it. <br>
2] Next, install the required dependencies by executing the following commands in terminal inside the backend directory:
```
npm install express cors mongodb dotenv
npm install -g nodemon
```
3] Run ```nodemon server``` to start the server.

## Note
I have made some changes of my own in the code (some commands/options in the tutorial have been deprecated/replaced in current versions).
